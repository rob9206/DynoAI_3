=== Anomaly Detection ===

1. [Spatial discontinuity] score=5.390963960634114
   cell: RPM 2000 / 95 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
2. [Spatial discontinuity] score=4.952382711006878
   cell: RPM 2500 / 95 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
