=== Anomaly Detection ===

1. [Spatial discontinuity] score=4.65951811375495
   cell: RPM 1500 / 50 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
2. [Spatial discontinuity] score=7.901214841628055
   cell: RPM 1500 / 80 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
3. [Spatial discontinuity] score=5.747566563974902
   cell: RPM 2000 / 35 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
4. [Spatial discontinuity] score=3.6278378983306507
   cell: RPM 5000 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
5. [Spatial discontinuity] score=5.7612205250772535
   cell: RPM 5500 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
