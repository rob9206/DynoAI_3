=== Anomaly Detection ===

1. [Spatial discontinuity] score=4.618549752651337
   cell: RPM 3500 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
2. [Spatial discontinuity] score=4.522255211831334
   cell: RPM 3500 / 80 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
3. [Spatial discontinuity] score=8.05673467204422
   cell: RPM 4500 / 50 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
4. [Spatial discontinuity] score=5.099002651815411
   cell: RPM 4500 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
