=== Anomaly Detection ===

1. [Spatial discontinuity] score=4.319702334101289
   cell: RPM 3500 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
2. [Spatial discontinuity] score=17.638549997293765
   cell: RPM 4000 / 65 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
