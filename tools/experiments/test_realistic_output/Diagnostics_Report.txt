=== Anomaly Detection ===

1. [Spatial discontinuity] score=3.5729350458355595
   cell: RPM 3500 / 50 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
2. [Spatial discontinuity] score=5.320021592665148
   cell: RPM 3500 / 95 kPa
   why: Large VE change vs neighbors; could be data artifact or real airflow quirk.
   next: Re-run steady-state in this cell, Inspect for vacuum leaks, throttle sync, or sensor noise
